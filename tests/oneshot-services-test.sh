# Regression test: one-shot containers must not be read as dead services.
#
# The e2e run failed on `moav-geoip-updater is exited (Exited (0)) — expected
# running`. geoip-updater downloads a database and exits 0; that is correct.
# The e2e step carried a hand-written list of one-shot jobs which had not been
# updated when geoip-updater and tor-geoip-updater were added, so a green stack
# failed the build.
#
# The list is derived from docker-compose.yml now. This test checks the rule
# still holds, and that the two other places which reason about one-shot jobs
# agree with it, because a hand-kept list is exactly what drifted.
