# Regression test: CLI surface consistency.
#
# Four small bugs, one shape: something is stated in more than one place, and the
# copies drifted.
#
# 1. `moav net` was dispatched but absent from `moav help`, so a working command
#    was undiscoverable. Guarded by comparing dispatch tokens to help text.
# 2. Community links were listed in three places -- the Ctrl+C goodbye, the help
#    footer, and the TUI exit (which had none). The help footer never gained the
#    GitHub link. They now come from one function.
# 3. The profile box rows were hand-padded and had drifted to 64, 65 and 66
#    columns inside a 65-column box, so the right border wobbled. Rows are now
#    width-padded from the label.
# 4. The sing-box version was pinned in NINE places, not the five that were
#    documented -- Dockerfile.bootstrap and Dockerfile.client embed it too, so a
#    partial bump silently ships a bootstrap that renders configs with a
#    different binary than the server runs.
