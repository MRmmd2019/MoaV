# Regression test: `moav regenerate-users` must reload the running WireGuard and
# AmneziaWG servers, not just sing-box + xray.
#
# The bug (found live): regenerate rebuilds wg0.conf/awg0.conf on disk, but the
# reload step only restarted `sing-box xray`. The WG/AWG containers kept their
# old peer lists, so a freshly regenerated user's key was on disk yet unknown to
# the running server — the tunnel handshook but the peer was never loaded.
# `moav user add` already reloads WG/AWG; regenerate-users was the gap.
